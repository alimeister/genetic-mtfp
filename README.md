# Optimizing MTFP using Genetic Algorithm

Welcome to the MTFP project, a genetic algorithm-based team formation platform! This code is designed to help you create the perfect team for any challenge, taking into account language preferences, work availability, skill levels, and communication styles. Our algorithm uses the Tuckman model to ensure smooth collaboration, and the results are presented in a clear and organized way. With MTFP, you can create teams that are not only highly skilled but also work together seamlessly.
